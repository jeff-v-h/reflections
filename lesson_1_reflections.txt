was introduced?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
Docs does?

uses programs that are generally used as standalones

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log to look at the history of commmits. make sure to scroll down to view.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
You know you can go back with commits and find the changes to fix or start
from there again
