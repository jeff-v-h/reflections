Lesson 2
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Use git init to intialise current folder with an empty Git repo. need to
'git add <file>' to include what will be committed.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
Files in the staging area are not altered in directory. This is where you decide
what changes you want to log as an actual commit. This allows you to organise
your commits to more easily sort through history and find bugs.
